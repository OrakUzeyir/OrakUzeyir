I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. \\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. \\nMore paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. \\nWells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. \\nMy property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. \\nThey can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. \\nI feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence. \\nAlthough my payments are back on track I am not making much more money now than I was before so it is only a matter of time before something like this happens again if something unforeseen happens to my life that affects my finances. \\n\n",

Chase is reporting the loan payments to XXXX but XXXX is surpressing the information and reporting the loan as Discharged in BK. This mortgage was reaffirmed in a Chapter XXXX BK discharged dated XXXX/XXXX/2013. Chase keeps referring to BK Law for Chapter XXXX and we keep providing documentation for Chapter XXXX, and the account should be open and current with all the payments \\n\n",

At the time I submitted this complaint, I had dealt with Rushmore Mortgage directly endeavoring to get them to stop the continuous daily calls I was receiving trying to collect on a mortgage for which I was not responsible due to bankruptcy. They denied having knowledge of the bankruptcy, even though I had spoken with them about it repeatedly and had written them repeatedly referencing the bankruptcy requesting them to cease the pursuit, they continued to do so. When they were unable to trick me into paying, force me into paying in retaliation they placed reported to my credit bureaus a past due mortgage amount that had been discharged in Federal Court. On XX/XX/XXXX Rushmore responded the referenced complaint indicating that they would remove the reporting from my bureau, yet it is still there now in XX/XX/XXXX. I would like them to remove it immediately and send me a letter indicating that it should not have been there in the first place and they are going to remove it from all my bureaus. Rushmore, when speaking to me, represented themselves as the new note holder, but when CFPB was involved, they identified themselves as the servicing agency for XXXX XXXX XXXX. This credit bullying and racial discrimination practices is damaging to anyone who is exposed to these tactics and this needs to stop. Them denying their intent and then walking away with no penalties of any kind is one of the reasons it continues. Please assist me in procuring the resolution once and for all. \\n\n",

According to my original documents with XXXX my PMI should be {$120.00}. However the loan was sold to Green tree. About XXXX months ago I noticed that Green tree is deducting out my escrow acct {$220.00} which i never agree to pay to Green tree, I have the supporting documents of what i signed in referance to this loan and the terms of the PMI. I would like this to be taken care of as soon as possible, as it stresses me out to think that Green tree is XXXX me off. I have asked and i expect a refund for all this time that i have been paying the wrong amount. I called Green tree a handful of times about this issue i have also fax them a letter showing my supporting documents and dont believe that now after more than 60 days of calling, and writing to them and this has still not been taken care of. It is Now XXXX XXXX which is more than enough time since this was brought their attention! This is XXXX more attemp to try and get a honest and fair response. I dont believe green tree is handleing this in a professional manner and I am very disappointed at not getting any responce at all about this matter. In all honesty it is looking to me that green tree has made a mistake here and is not ready to fix it and compensate me because if its was something i did owe on PMI they would have brought proof to me quickly. I would appriciate any kind of attempt to fix this \\n\n",

Harris & assoc. used deceptive collection practices while attempting to collect on a purchased debt. Once initial contact had been made and a discussion on solutions to resolve the debt, the attorney office sent out a summons for an appearance in court. The representative had advised us that \" we should not worry because we will receive several of these notifications. '' However, there was a case filed in the city court and required an immediate response to avoid a default judgment. This summons was used as a collection tool while in mutual good faith discussion on how to repay the debt. The representatives refused to discuss reasonable payment arrangements and told us to deal with the courts. When I inquired as to why a summons was sent out while we were talking to their agency in good faith I was hung up on. After calling back XXXX times I was finally connected to a supervisor who again tried to tell me not to worry about the summons. As I inquired further as to the reason of the summons I was hung up on again. I was hung up on a total of XXXX times while asking to speak to a manager or an attorney within their office. This debt is over XXXX years old and was supposedly incurred by my mother in law who is on a fixed income and under the care of XXXX. Every time I had requested documentation or verification of the debt I was told to deal with it in court -- even though I was assured prior, that nothing had been sent or filed with the court! I am an advocate for my mother in law while dealing with what I consider to be an unprofessional and unscrupulous debt collector. The summons was sent just to solidify their subtle threats of garnishment, liens, or any other means at their disposal. My concern is that this would appear to be a regular occurrence with this agency. Once the attorney office makes contact with a consumer they issue a summons to scare the debtor. My mother in law was served on XXXX/XXXX/15 ; we had started discussing the debt on XXXX/XXXX/15 which means they ordered it while we were discussing in good faith our options on the debt. Mel S. Harris & assoc is using the power and intimidation of the summons and the court system as a scare tactic and collection tool to coerce and discriminate against consumers \\n\n",

This bank never had a loan on my property because it was paid out before the banks merged. About two years after contacting the bank the filed a affidavit stating the bank did not hire nor pay this firm to file the foreclosure. Once I contacted the bank the firm tried to get it dismissed and erased from record. \\n\n",

I immediately went to my bank and closed the account and reopened a new one and received new checks with a different account number. The person who stole my wallet had used my debit card ... but since it was still pending ... the bank was able to block the withdrawal. I placed a fraud alert on my credit reports and I got a new driver 's license and then ended up getting a XXXX one with my new name since I had married. \\nLast week I received a letter from Meade & Associates attempting to collect on a debt from XXXX checks written on my old account with my old drivers license name starting in XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and he agreed that everything was done correctly, I just needed to send him the information from my bank and the police report along with my current drivers license. I requested that he send me copies of the checks that were written, which he did. I went to my bank and they did not have anything specific since nothing actually went through my account at the time. However, they new I had closed that account and reopened the new one and that I had presented them with a police report. They wrote me a letter to give to XXXX XXXX and I was able to retrieve the police report online. Monday, XXXX XXXX, I faxed both of these documents along with my current drivers license, my actual signature, as well as the new police report number for the case filed with the forgery/fraud department. I followed up with a call to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday and was informed he was not available, but they would have him return my call. I called Wednesday afternoon and was then told that he had left early that day without returning my call. I asked if anyone else could help. I was transferred to XXXX. She obtained the documents that I had faxed and I explained to her I wanted to finalize clearing this ordeal. She became hateful and kept saying she needed documents that I she already had. She stated I still needed an affidavit from my bank stating I did not write the checks ... she refused to listen to anything I had to say and acted is if it did not matter what I sent ... it was n't going to make a difference. At that point I definitely became angry and she told me to never call that office again. I called my bank and told them what was going on and they stated that XXXX did not know what she was talking about because the bank never had me sign an affidavit because nothing had actually gone through my account since I had immediately blocked all transactions due to closing the account. The check transactions even clearly say that when they were processed there was no account found. I am currently waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective ... but I am filing reports and claims to help prevent any more aggravation from this company and hope they will learn that you ca n't treat people like criminals when they are the victims in some circumstances ... especially when they present facts and proof. \\n\n",

Recently I got a call from a Collection Agency who said the debt has not been paid. The healthcare provider and I were in agreement that they 'd take care of billing but somehow my name was thrown into the mix. The healthcare agency does not respond to my inquiries about the debt or to the collection agency 's inquiries about the debt. This has a possibility of ruining my credit. \\n\n",

They used the funds from my account to pay taxes on someone else 's property - landing me in collections with the XXXX County tax department. They have since paid off the collections, but are showing the additional amount as being part of my payoff amount ( meaning they are charging me XXXX for property taxes ). When my attorney and I have requested that they update the payoff since it was not my error, they are not helping me. They have told me they have to wait for the refund from XXXX County. When I contacted XXXX County, they advised me they do not refund mortgage companies for issues such as this. They said the mortgage company has to request the funds from the owner of the property that they erroneously paid. Nationstar is now saying they did not make a mistake. My attorney has documentation showing the issue and that I am being penalized for this, which is making it impossible for me to refinance my loan to a lower interest rate ( this is how we noticed the issue ). I have spent literally hours trying to get this resolved - many times being disconnected and given incorrect call back numbers or numbers that route to the wrong department. I also gave each of the representatives my call back number and no one has called me back. I left several messages with XXXX in the tax department and she never returned my calls. I want to move my loan from this company ( which could be accomplished through a refi ), but they are showing me as owing {$6000.00} more than I should, which means I would have to come out of pocket and hope for a reimbursement at some point. \\n\n",

I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the XXXX charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because HD was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. \\nIn this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/2015? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The c/s XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the XXXX refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providingTRANSUNION with real incorrect information, slandering my name. Transunion sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Transunion and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XXXX XXXX 2015 and the personal info is dated XXXX/XXXX/15 and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type \" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XXXX/XXXX/15 and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a XXXX balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a XXXX balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account. \\n\n",

I am outraged at the method of deception which was put into to play last year and is still going. The first thing is the way that they state in the letter that the fraud case issue was denied by their Security Operations dept. Well it was the dept who advised me about the double charge for the refrigerators and they made no mention about the case regarding the fraud was denied, because XXXX was the XXXX doing the fraud to me. \\nIn this letter there is no mention about the refrigerator XXXX charge and it also states that they only received XXXX payment of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX? ( THAT DATE IS FUTURE ) That payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with other payments made to pay the account off in full. They stated that I did not cooperate and provide a declaration for unauthorized use, that is not true as I called to find out why there had been charges made in the months I did not use the card. The XXXX XXXX was a rude bias man and he made up the whole story because he was already covering up the fact that there were the bogus charges for the second refrigerator that had APR charges and late fees they could not reverse. He chose not to disclose that information and he was the one who made those negative remarks said to be by me, and now I believe that XXXX have together started providing Experian the real incorrect information, slandering my name. Experian sent me XXXX credit files, XXXX saying that there was a error by XXXX and then a XXXX that has trashed my entire credit file and fico score. I called Experian and told them to remove the fraud alert. They asked for the removal request to be provided in writing and in fact they did the opposite and issued an Extensive Fraud Alert. The strange thing I that the credit file is dated XX/XX/XXXX and the personal info is dated XX/XX/XXXX and there is a note stating File Blocked for Promotional Purposes. For the revolving accounts they have noted that they are paid as agreed buy it states in bold type \" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION-Credit Card. There are also accounts that they have reported that have been closed per my request and they are not accounts I have had, not to mention a public record I do not know about. They have done this to raise additional flags for my credit history and create problems for any future loans or credit card app. I may request. Well during this dispute the credit dept for XXXX XXXX loaded up my credit file with a great deal of negative information and my FICO score went from XXXX to a XXXX. I ordered my credit report and reported all of this to the XXXX agencies. So I decided to use this XXXX XXXX credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and it was only for the deposit of a tool rental and at the register the clerk told me it was declined. I called the number on the card and after stating my card number the automated stated I had a zero balance and I was eligible for deferred charging. I asked to speak w/ a rep and he stated that my account was closed per customer request. That was not true I had not requested the account to be closed and the credit report does not make that indication. I believe that this was done in retaliation as I am still receiving emails stating that my account has a zero balance and is active, as well as more marketing emails encouraging me to use my account.

I am also unable to access my free anual credit report online via the annualcreditreport.com website. I was told the size of the report is causing this and may be related to the number of soft inquiries generated by reviewing my own report. As I had previously been a victim of Identity Theft, I checked my report almost daily for new/unauthorized inquiries or accounts appearing. That is why online access is so important to me. Now, apparently the file size will not allow online access and I must mail in a form to get a copy of my report. For someone who is monitoring their credit for identity theft in the event someone attempts to open an account in my name, I need to be able to access my credit information without waiting two weeks for XXXX in the mail. \\n\n",

Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to \" Global Lending '' on XXXX via USPS certified mail.

I immediately contacted the bank and was informed that fraudulent charges were detected on my XXXX credit card and the bank closed the account to protect me from further fraudulent activity. I was alarmed because I have had this account for 5 years and I have not utilized the card in more than 4 years and it had a XXXX balance with a {$10000.00} limit. The bank assured me that all charges would be reversed and any fees associated with this issue would be reversed as well. I was also told that the charges arose from a cafe in XXXX where someone was purchasing coffee and snacks. I advised the bank that I have never been to XXXX to assure them that I had no part in this fraudulent activity. The bank representative at Bank of America said that I would receive a new card in the mail in 7-10 days. When that card did not arrive I re-contacted Bank of America and was told the card should have been received so they would issue a XXXX replacement card via priority mail ( signature required ). I did receive the XXXX replacement card. My problem with this entire process is now that I have the new card the associated fees for the replacement and the fraudulent charges have not been reversed completely as Bank of America promised. Now there is a 30 day late payment on my credit report for the fraudulent charges and fees totaling {$31.00}. This late payment has affected my qualification and approval for a mortgage that I was in the process of obtaining. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Bank of America again to discuss this matter and they apologized for the inconvenience and assured me that the fees are being reversed and the 30 day late on my credit report would be reversed in 30-60 days. This is not acceptable. I do not want to have this negative notation impede my mortgage loan processing or impact my mortgage interest rate negatively. \\n\n",

Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to \" Capital One Auto Finance d/b/a COAF '' on XXXX via XXXX certified mail.

Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX OH contacted said collection firm and asked to set up a payment schedule - debited directly from my bank account. Attorney XXXX NEVER had a call returned from XXXX XXXX the contact person on record for this action with Javitch & Co. in XXXX OH. I am on Social Security, as my only source of income. \\nBeing a seasonal employee at XXXX XXXX in XXXX - I was contacted by XXXX XXXX that my wages would be garnished at 25 % of net pay, when I worked for XXXX XXXX - working for XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX - I had {$2800.00} garnished from my paychecks - a MAJOR setback for my finances as my Social Security barely covers my monthly overhead. \\nEfforts by Attorney XXXX to reach XXXX XXXX at Javitch & Co. to arrive at an equitable monthly payment - directly debited from my account. Went unanswered by phone and writing. \\nA complete written history since judgement was rendered by the court toward my effort to establish payment schedule, through counsel is 100 % factual. This Collection agency - Javitch & Co. has totally ignored all requests by counsel & has circumvented equitable protocol to establish a payment schedule for re-payment of this debt. \\n\n",

A little over a week later I got a letter requesting that I fax in a copy of my DL, Social, and utility bill for address verification which I did on XXXX/XXXX/15. Fast forward to today, XXXX/XXXX/15 and I have not heard anything back so I called M & T bank to find out the status and I was told that they still have not reviewed it and my {$500.00} was on hold. I demanded that my account get shut down and my {$500.00} returned but I was told that could not happen until they reviewed my information that was faxed and released the hold on my account. I asked how long that would take and I was told it would take as long as they want, which would render my {$500.00} hostage until they got around to figuring stuff out. \\n\n",

Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to \" JPM Chase d/b/a JP Morgan Chase '' on XX/XX/2014 via XXXX certified mail.

When I answered the individual informed me they were from World Wide Assets and this was an attempt to collect a debt. I then informed him that I was at work and could n't receive personal calls at my work number and asked that all calls stop and I hung up. He then called right back and I reiterate that I could n't have personal calls at work and hung up again. \\n\n",

They keep referring me back to the courthouse and when I contact the courthouse, they are indicating that they did not report nor do they do any reporting to the credit bureaus, so they ca n't help me. \\n\\nThe staff at the courthouse also provided the above information in writing. After submitting it to XXXX and Equifax, they still refuse to remove this inaccurate information from my credit report. \\n\n",

However, I did this already with FTC and it does n't apply to this company. The account was removed but the inquires are still listed on my report and it is hurting my credit. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to \" XXXX Name '' on XXXX via XXXX certified mail & again XXXX. The company refuses to honor my rights under the XXXX as a victim of identity theft to remove the fraudulent inquiry that was submitted without my knowledge, consent and/or authorization. \\n\\nPlease find attached the notice that was sent out along with the attached certified receipt.

I have attempted to settle the debt immediately with them if the account classification is corrected but the refuse repeatedly stating that even if I pay them in full they will leave the account on my record incorrectly. \\n\\nThe property in question was a home I purchased alone in XXXX that became a rental property when my husband and I purchased another home in XXXX. The home was lost due to an illegal foreclosure by XXXX or XXXX as its now known. I attempted to rectify this situation, as my tenant and the XXXX Housing Authority failed to make timely or payments at all in some instances but my only resolve has been the receipt of an {$1100.00} settlement check from a national Class action lawsuit, naming XXXX at fault for the wrongful/Illegal foreclosure. \\n\\nAs stated before if the only resolve short of litigation is to pay the debt, I have no problem making a settlement to rectify the situation if that is whats necessary to satisfy the XXXX mortgage, but it just does n't seem right that my home was illegally taken, a settlement was paid to me to provide some compensation to my family and now we are again having our credit damaged due to something beyond our control as the collection did n't take place right away but approximately 3 years later and because its being reported incorrectly as a mortgage account not a collection account, legally my family is unable to purchase a new home due to the new mortgage laws. Had we known this was a possibility, we never would have sold our last home in XXXX XXXX. Therefore my husband, myself and XXXX children are displaced due to their false representation. \\n\\nWe have attempted contacting the credit bureaus as well and have been unsuccessful. \\n\n",

I accepted the offer. The first payment was due in the month of XXXX. As a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received 30 day XXXX in the month of XXXX. None-the-less I called Carrington to make the XXXX trial modification payment over the phone. Carrington refused to take the payment over the phone but instead demanded that I send via XXXX XXXX. Because of my service I explained to Carrington that I would have limited access to XXXX XXXX and I faxed my XXXX. Carrington stood firm in their unreasonableness. I was able to get to a XXXX XXXX office on XXXX XXXX, but Carrington refused to accept the payment because they claimed it was late. My Authorized XXXX Party representative called Carrington on XXXX separate occasions - XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, 2015. The purpose of each call was to determine whether or not there was a scheduled foreclosure sale date. Each time the Authorized XXXX Party Representative was told there was not a foreclosure sale date. Carrington completed a foreclosure sale on XXXX XXXX, 2015. At the time of the foreclosure sale I remained out-of-town due to the XXXX mentioned above. \\n\n",

            "192148                 Mortgage                                                                                                                           I got behind in payments and worked with B of A 's loan modification dept. in XXXX. In order to keep my home, I made an arrangement for a XXXX month payoff in which I made higher payments each month until the balance was caught up. I was able at that time to make the payments high enough that I actually got caught up in 4 months. I was sent a letter on XXXX stating \" You are approved for a {$27000.00} principal forgiveness on your home loan ''. The letter stated that if I wanted to accept their offer that I did not need to do anything, if you have questions to call XXXX. I did call them because I had questions. I specifically asked that if I waited until XXXX to sell my home even if it was in the middle of escrow on XXXX, would I receive the credit on the principal balance on my loan, would there be any waiting period such as 30 days or more. I was told that I would receive the credit even if I was in escrow as long as it was after XXXX. I put my house on the market and it sold. We specifically waited until after XXXX to close and had a closing date of XXXX. It was discovered through the escrow office as I read the documents that the credit amount was still in the debit column rather than the credit. I immediately called B of A. I made multiple attempts to correct it as quickly as possible with B of A. My case manager XXXX XXXX was always responsive and helpful. It was n't until I discovered the error that B of A became unresponsive, uncooperative, provided different information on the phone each time I called, routed me over and over to different departments because \" that person was unable to assist me in that department ''. It all came to a head on XXXX when I desperately tried reaching XXXX XXXX to find out why the credit was not showing up. Reps. at B of A kept telling me that my case manager was not in and still I would get a different response each time I called. XXXX rep. stated that the credit would not be available until 30 days, another 60 days, another 90 days. I was so frustrated ; I called my attorney and was advised to file a complaint with you. On XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX. Since we had such a good working relationship when I performed my obligations to repay my modification early, she called me asking why I had contacted B of A the day before. I explained the issue with the escrow and the credit not showing up in my loan escrow docs and that the buyer is forcing the close of the house and I was going to be out the credit because it was not reflected on the statement. XXXX XXXX was actually very upset that none of her co-workers reached out to her on any of my calls the day before because she WAS in the office XXXX XXXX assured me that everything is now correct but it wo n't be reflected until I receive my XXXX statement which is typically generated between the XXXX and XXXX of each month. If I had known that I had to wait until after the XXXX statement was generated to reflect the credit, I would have waited to sell my home until that date. The buyer is now forcing the sale of the sale and I am going to be out the credit amount if B of A does not update their records immediately, it might still be too late. I did everything that B of A asked of me and fulfilled my loan mod. in 4 months rather than XXXX. I am XXXX and selling my home because I can no longer live in this particular home. I feel that I was mislead, and not provided the correct information and the EXACT date the credit would be reflected. The letter is poorly written and the customer service reps. seem to not want to help or provide incorrect information. They just want to send you from XXXX department to another to completely frustrate you so that you give up and B of A makes more money ; it seems like a scam. They did not fulfill their end of the financial obligation. \\n\n",

The initial disclosure provided to me indicated a promotional rate of 0.00 APR on purchases ( 6 months ) and balance transfers ( for 15 months ). Upon receiving my card the disclosure provided did not reference the promotional rate on the balance transfers, therefore I called the company to discuss and was told the promotional was only on purchases. Therefore, I submitted a complaint through the bank 's website on XXXX/XXXX/15. After several back and forth responses and a letter received, it was still being indicated the promotional rate is only on purchases. As already expressed this is not what was initially disclosed to me and therefore this is deceptive to me as a consumer as I made a credit decision based on the initially information provided to me that appear to be false. I have provided the link below that provided the terms and conditions of the card that included the promotional rate of balance transfers. My other concern is what other deceptive practices might the bank be conducting. \\n\\nhttps : //www.barclaycardus.com/apply/Landing.action?

They contacted me a little over a year ago regarding this. I called and spoke with someone who had me fax over the paperwork that I have showing that it was paid in full. I called again to confirm that he received it and he said that he did and that everything looked to be in order. He said that if he had any other questions that he would call me back. I never heard from them again until just recently when they sent me the same paperwork again. I paid this debt off 7 years ago. \\n\n",

To be brief, in XX/XX/XXXX I filed bankruptcy with my now ex husband and surrendered a home. BKY discharged in XX/XX/XXXX. To this date, the home has NOT yet foreclosed! After more than 7 years! This mortgage was part of that Countrywide/BOA buyout issue and the foreclosure has started and stopped many times. Currently, the case is closed, without foreclosing. The judge just this year ordered the note to go back to the mtg company, and closed the case. I have since then remarried, and have worked very hard rebuilding my credit. Even though I am not responsible for this debt anylonger due to the bankruptcy, I still can not qualify for a loan until 7 years past a foreclosed date!!! My score is over XXXX now, but due to the home not foreclosing, it has stopped me from moving on with my life, and purchsing a home with my husband. I have written nurmerous letters to the bank as well as one to the XXXX of Florida, and have been directed to you for assistance. I have seen homes foreclose within a year or so, and mine has been over 7!!! Can you please help?? The way this is going, with the case not being assigned to anyone, after being buried for years, this can continue indefinately for years and years. Please help. THIS HOME NEEDS TO FORECLOSE. Former name XXXX XXXX. I will supply documentation of surrendered home in bky pwk when contacted. Original bank was Countrywide, and BOA purchased the loan. \\n\n",

XX/XX/XXXXTo whom it may concern, I have been receiving these types of letters since last year XX/XX/XXXX. I have also spoken to XXXX different representatives on your end in regards to this. The XXXX times that I have called XXXX representatives were unable to provide information but the following:1. The account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX ( I was only XXXX ). \\n2. The account name is \" Structure ''. ( What is \" Structure ''? NOBODY can explain to me what \" Structure '' is? ). \\n\\nMy thoughts, concerns and question is WHY after 11 years was this being brought to my attention in XX/XX/XXXX? Why ca n't anyone from MCM tell me what this account/credit/ '' Structure '' was for/is? \\nI have XXXX DEBT under my name. I have ran my credit reports yearly and most recently back in XX/XX/XXXX and have never seen any of this? \\n\\nIf MCM and nobody on the business end can provide me with any of the following information to explain to me who, what, when this account was and what it was? I wish that MCM make no more contact or communication with me and wish to please be forgiven of this mysterious \" debt '' I owe in the amount of {$990.00}. I have done all that I can do by receiving these letters, following up with MCM and I get the same run around with no answers to my questions and especially this \" debt '' going on 11 years now. \\n\\nAgain I am asking you to please forgive me of the above debt. This has been a hassle for the last year on my end. Nobody can provide me with any type of paperwork, documentation, signature or what \" Structure '' is? \\n\\nUntil further notice please do not contact me via mail or phone. \\n\\nI thank you kindly for your time and patience in regards to receiving and reading this letter! \\n\n",
            "192396                 Mortgage                                           Wells Fargo Mortgage began foreclosure action due to non-payment that we had set up auto pay option on. Did not receive notification that auto payment option was cancelled nor did we receive information regarding foreclosure action until we attempted to make a purchase. We contacted them and asked if they could waive late fees and reinstatement fees since we were not notified. After speaking with them at length, they indicated after conducting their research they felt they were not at fault and denied any waiver of either fees. They felt that regardless of any previous discussion that they had sent written notification to us that there were no payments set up automatically, and that we should have contacted them once we received that. After advising them we did n't receive the letter they stated that we should have been monitoring our account and making sure the payments were being made and we would have known that way. Throughout a month 's worth of phone calls with multiple employees of Wells Fargo beginning on XXXX/XXXX/15, I was provided misinformation almost every time I called in. Some examples include the individuals each time had to be explained the entire story and they would explain what their records reflected on the account and none of the information was what was actually discussed. They had indicated we had never requested reinstatement letter, then that it would be mailed when we had asked for a fax ; they stated we had not received it because they were busy and to check back, and once we did they stated a second reinstatement letter had been requested ; after following up again we were told they had begun a loan modification process which was never requested ; when asking for a supervisor the call was conveniently disconnected ; each time we called the same number we received a different staff member sometimes in a different state ; every call they were asked if we could go into an office and speak with someone and were told there was none local ; after multiple requests for information sent in some other form than a fax we were told they do n't use email only XXXX. After XXXX Wells Fargo and calling a different number we were told XXXX person had been assigned to our case. This was not until XXXX/XXXX/15. After finally receiving a call from this person after leaving messages, we were told the request to waive fees would be denied and a letter would be sent XXXX, we have still not received it. We were told if the fees were not paid by XXXX that there would be additional fees incurred and they were still pursuing the foreclosure. We ended up paying the fees to get the home out of foreclosure and received a verbal answer that this has been done. When asking for written confirmation, we were advised we would receive this via email which was interesting because up until this time this was not possible. We still do n't have this letter. They had said they do not use electronic communication for security purposes. We were also advised we would receive a written account of their research and determination not to waive fees which would be sent overnight mail but have not received this either. When asked if our credit had been updated to reflect that we were current, we were told they would take care of this only after our next month mortgage payment was made which is not due until the beginning of the month. The money for our mortgage payments was being payroll deducted into a Wells Fargo checking account and was sitting there rather than being taken out for the mortgage. We do n't even bank with them normally and only opened the account for the mortgage payments.

The next year when the analysis was done they lowered it to {$1400.00}. They recently sold my mortgage to seneca mortgage and I have received a letter from them on XXXX XXXX 2015 stating that my mortgage will be going up to {$1900.00}. I called to inquire and was told that my escrow had a shortage and I could also pay the shortage in a one lump sum. I do n't have that kind of money. I then called XXXX who sold my mortgage to seneca and was told that who ever did my analysis made an mistake and did n't include my pmi insurance but not to worry because they paid it for me. I find that hard to believe. I want to know how the new company can charge me this money when the previous company made an error in the analysis.XXXX said they were aware of the mistake but no one took the time to call us so that we could have rectified this before it got to this stage. I had spoken to the new company and they are not willing to work out anything other than payment in full of back escrow or up my payment $ XXXX.How is it our mistake when the bank created the problem.I 'm sure if we made a mistake they would be the XXXX ones on the phone to get their money.This is like selling a car to someone and then realizing you could have gotten more and then go back to that person for the difference. \\n\n",

They are no longer cashing my check that 's on their back unless I have a major credit card? Or they said I can use a work Id I work for myself do n't have one, or a passport, it cost {$100.00} 's of dollars I do n't have that kind of money and lastly they said a car registration I do n't have a car. this is oppression to the poor, If I can ; t qualify for a major credit card how can I pay my bills? This should not be allowed because not everyone can qualify, if my drivers license and debit card is ok to drive and use my debit card everywhere major credit cards are accepted I do n't see how this is not an acceptable form of ID for PNC \\n\n",

Equifax sold me XXXX XXXX protection service, then upgraded it to another, and then downgraded when the XXXX did not work, and then added an additional XXXX for my wife, as they could not network with XXXX to link the XXXX agencies together. I was supposed to have XXXX service covering \" the family '', tying to all XXXX credit reporting services to both my wife and my social security numbers, but they ended up charging me for XXXX, with no complete coverage. \\nEquifax instructed me to call XXXX to fix the error. Once I finally found a phone number that connected to live human, XXXX said there was no issue and I should get back on the phone with Equifax and they can directly call XXXX and work out any issues. Equifax said they could not solve the problem, it was up to XXXX and I should wait two weeks for all my credit reports to arrive by mail so I could compare them. At this point, after about 4 hours on the phone with these XXXX agencies, I asked Equifax for the accounts to be cancelled and a refund since I had not ever used the service nor logged onto the accounts. Equifax cancelled the accounts, but refused to give credit even though their product did not do what they sold it to me to do, plus they sold it to me only three hours or less prior to cancellation. \\nI did not use their product ever as it was not what they said it was and they could not get it to work as they said it would. Since the the product did not do as it was sold to me, I expect them to stand behind it and provide a refund - no way. They say once XXXX and I figure out what is wrong, it will work. \\nEquifax uses high pressure sales to sell you a product that if it does not work, too bad, you still pay at least XXXX month 's monitoring. I agreed to the extra products as the Equifax person suggested I could have everyone on the family plan by the end of the day - not even close. It would take at least XXXX weeks minimum just to find the issue by me, and then who knows how long to get it resolved since the credit reporting agencies leave it up to me to fix. \\n\n",

She passed away on XXXX. There will be no probate. She had a pour-over will so anything not titled to her trust and anything w/o a beneficiary goes into her trust. I contacted Discover Bank ( an online bank ) for the XXXX time on XXXX/XXXX/15 where my sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX, has a savings account. ( I have had XXXX other contacts, all initiated by me. ) I sent them my certified documents ( about XXXX pages in total over the last month ) stating who I was, about the trust, etc.. and asked XXXX questions : Were any beneficiaries listed on this account and if so, who? ( So I can let them know as it would be my niece and nephew. ) What was the Date of Death value ( which I must report to the IRS to account for the value of the estate )? What is the current value? They told me that once they received my papers they would answer my questions. Now they are saying they wo n't ; that they do n't \" recognize the authority of XXXX County ( WA ) Superior Court and that they want \" Probate '' papers. They refuse to recognize my authority and they also refused to bundle up all my documents and send them to their attorneys. I am at an impasse. \\n\n",

They bought it from XXXX XXXX XXXX. We have never missed a payment or been late. We have changed insurance carriers several times and this statement will become clear once I state the problem. In XXXX of 2015 we changed from XXXX XXXX to XXXX for our house insurance. XXXX XXXX sent a check for XXXX back to use. We called Carrington to ask what should be done with the money. They gave me and address in Texas to send the money to. We were instructed to explain where the money was suppose to go. I sent a check and a letter stating to put the money back in escrow. The check was cashed on the XXXX of XXXX. I also made my XXXX payment of XXXX. Now the problem is that they are saying that they never got said check. At XXXX they were saying they could not find the house payment either. Well I sent a copy of bank statement show that the check was cashed. My husband called them starting XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX said that he would check into it call him back. Friday the XXXX no call so my husband called back. XXXX stated that the computers were messed up. Well no call Monday so we called back and got someone named XXXX would not disclose her last name. Said she was head Supervisor. Said she would look and call. Still waiting for that call. Now they will not take our calls and have blocked us on the web site. The main issue is the XXXX plus trying to raise our payments by XXXX for more escrow money. \\n\n",

The problem is I was just made aware that Bank of America no longer conducts business with them. As result I 'm out of the money that I paid to the insurance company. Well XXXX there was a refund sent to Bank of America on my behalf. Instead of Bank of America sending me the check they applied as a a credit which brought the balance down. No problem right. None for me as well however not only did they bring the balance down they said that is not a payment. Its a credit, I said this is something that I paid monthly and its not like I went to the store and purchased something and than returned it in that case that would be a credit. This service was to be provided for customers in the event they were unable to pay there bill. The issue is Bank of America accepted the payment and than charged me late fees .Closed the account and reported me late to the credit bureaus. I 've made a numerous of attempts to reach out to them and have yet to have this matter resolved recently my wife reached out to your office and a complaint was submitted and we received correspondence from a woman by the name of XXXX XXXX who works with XXXX department of customer care for complaints. Let me start off by saying she was absolutely rude and combative and I hope I never need to deal with her again. She sends us an email stating she wants to resolve this issue please give her a call and than we call her and she is very combative. My wife resubmits a complaint addressing the level of dissatisfaction we received only for the complaint to go back to the same person whom was the one that was being combative. The problem is Bank of America is receiving my money that I work hard for applying to the account and saying there is n't a payment that was n't made because this came from the insurance company. The insurance was again in the event I was unable to pay my bill they would pay it. Although Bank of America no longer does business with this company. The insurance company refunded the consumers some of the money and it was either sent as a check. Bank of America takes my money and than says there is not payment it is a credit. Which cant be a credit because that was a payment made for a service that was never rendered. What Bank of America is doing is stealing. They are charge me a late fee for something that was n't late. Its no different if I have a friend pay my monthly bill. You cant say your applying that payment as credit because someone else paid and that charge me late payments. That is completely unethical. \\n\n",

I got another bill in the mail plus emails on my computer called them up and they told me the last info I sent them was n't right so I explained what I sent them and was told that it would work and they would get back a hold of me in 2 to 3 business days and that I would be able to pay the bill at that time i waited to here back from them never did and contacted them again. they told me the info was not good enough and I had to send more information. I at this point told them to forget it and take me out of there system.they toldme okay and I would recive conformation in two to 3 buissness day in I never did after numorous calls and complaints I am still in there system they turned this into the credit agency during this whole process and it shows as a unpaid bill it has lowerd my credit score enough that ino longer qualify for the home loan i was getting I had a XXXX before all this its now down to a XXXX I needed a XXXX and every thing was fine. so I am stuck staying at a friends house because of a card that I never seen had or used and being forced into getting checks to pay them for something I do n't have they said the only way I can pay for this bill for a card I do n't have and never had is to get checks and mail it to them I am totally frustaited with this hole thing \\n\n",

The promotion was for {$200.00} if I had a direct deposit of at least 700 dollars and XXXX bill pays per month. I signed up for the bill pay and the direct deposit. Prior to signing up i called customer service a few time to confirm the promotion. I was told that I should be set up and the promotion should pay in XXXX. I followed up at the begining of this month only to learn from an associate that the account is set up on a promotion to receive a 200 dollar credit for a 2,000 dollar monthly direct deposit. That is not the information that I received on the promotion. Nor is it what i was it the information that I received from the customer service representatives that I talked to. I did everything that was asked of me, and they changed the rules. I spoke to a supervisor and she told me that she cant pull the phone calls because the conversation was too long ago, she asked that I provide the link that I received the promo offer for. Unfortunatly, I no longer have the link ... 5 months later it is hardly likely that I still have the link that I went to to sign up. Its unfair to trick me into getting an account that charges me 15 dollars per month and not receive what was promised to me. I just want the credit that was promised to me. \\n\n",

My husband lost his job in XXXX XXXX and we got behind. We tried to work arrangements out with Green Tree. They are refusing my payment unless I bring it current. They are calling several times a day and faxing over personal info and payment history to my work fax and my co workers seen it. I paid a XXXX payment in XXXX $ 4200- because of there threats of taking my home. I paid another XXXX in XXXX and called another payment in for XXXX in XXXX. I was told I am still XXXX payment behind and needed to pay {$4200.00} for XXXX not XXXX and that would bring me current. I explained to them I do not have it. I then received another call a few minutes later from another account Rep - who handles my Account - I was threatened they would void my payment for that day and it would put me 60 days past due. I asked again to speak with a manager - who then gets on the phone and says they will look in to it. I called back the next day and asked if my payment had been voided, I was told no. I pulled my bank statement up and see they reversed it back into my bank account. How can they refuse a payment after excepting it. The tactics they use are not right for those who are trying to keep our homes. They are purposely refusing PAYMENT to damage my credit and make me loose my home. What can I do?? They told me to file foreclosure. I can not believe they would want to push a customer into foreclosure over being XXXX payment past due. I am trying to keep my home and have always paid on time until my husband lost his job. I have proof of them excepting the payment then voiding it. I believe they are playing games, I have talked to several people who claim to be managers who say they will look into it with no follow up. \\n\n",

However, no one sent a response. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to \" AFS Acceptance, LLC. '' on XX/XX/2014 via USPS certified mail. The company refuses to honor my rights under the FDCPA & the FCRA as a victim of identity theft to remove the fraudulent inquiry that was submitted without my knowledge, consent and/or authorization. \\n\\nPlease find attached the notice that was sent out along with the attached certified receipt.

I have never rec 'd anything in the mail before on this. I called the Dr offfice and they say it was because visits that are being billed didnt have a referral but I always had a referral and if they told me that I would have gotten XXXX. I have attached proof that my primary care physician did send referrals. I feel as though this is some sort of way for them to bill people almost 5 years later knowing they will pay or it will kill their credit. I am in the XXXX and will be forced to pay something that is not accurate almost 5 years after the services. \\n\n",

In XX/XX/XXXX, we paid down on our dream home. This is an XXXX and half bedroom condo in the heart of XXXX -- - ( no car needed ) XX/XX/XXXX, we were informed that BOA had sold their XXXX units to XXXX XXXX, an out of state acquisition company. A meeting was held on XX/XX/XXXX, by the new purchasers. At this meeting, we the few owners were informed that because they ( new owners ) were the majority stakeholders, they could do away with the condo Bylaws. Thus the Bylaws were amended and the new board appointed. \\nWe were told the following : Sell our units to the new owners at the same price which was given to them by BOA Continue to live in our unit -- -knowing that the building will no longer abide by the condo Bylaws, but instead will be operated and managed as an apartment complex. \\nWe were also informed that we will never be able to sell our unit on the open market because of the rental average of the building. \\nOur condo was purchased in good faith. We 'd everything that was right under the law. The present situation we are in is no fault of ours. The housing market tanked, and BOA did what was best for them -- -sold their units to the highest bidder -- - NOT CARING ABOUT HOW THEIR DECISION WOULD AFFECT THEIR HONEST CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASED AND HAVE MORTGAGES WITH THEM. -- -- TOO BIG TO CARE. The investors on the other hand needed to realize a profit quickly changed the Bylaws to protect their investment. Who cares about ordinary Americans like us no one? We are the casualty of the housing bubble. We could have walked away them this situation like many other American, but we did n't because we are honest FOOLS. \\n\n",

Prior to the sell, I had never heard of this company. As a result of the sell Green Tree opened an escrow account, to pay property taxes and insurance, I never had a escrow account before and do not believe the State of California requires lenders to maintain an escrow account. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30+ year mortgage and the monthly mortgage payment is {$1200.00} and I pay $ XXXX monthly to cover the escrow payment for property taxes and insurance. According to my monthly statement from Green Tree, my regular monthly payment is {$1500.00} so I pay roughly {$11.00} per month more than is required which I acknowledge was no designated to be applied to the escrow account until I recently made my XXXX payment. Despite my attempts to comply with the terms of this loan, every year since Green Tree has held our mortgage we get a bill for XXXX of dollars, this year it was {$800.00}, supposedly because of escrow shortages. Every year it 's a different amount, but the escrow shortages are always for XXXX of dollars and the amount of insurance and property taxes we pay annually does not increase that much to justify these increases of XXXX of dollars each year. Green Tree provides this annual escrow account disclosure statement with this convoluted calculation to justify these increases ( copy attached ). This year XXXX days prior to receiving the annual escrow account disclosure statement we received a letter from Green Tree stating that our account was current ( copy attached ). Each year I contact Green Tree to get someone to explain these calculations and I have yet to understand the justification or the explanation. If you do n't pay the amount of the shortage Green Tree threatens to increase the amount of your regular monthly payment to cover the shortage. I find it hard to believe it is legal for a mortgage company to charge a borrower XXXX of dollars more per year to maintain an escrow account if it 's cheaper for the borrower to pay their own property taxes and insurance. If the borrower 's property taxes and insurance are not delinquent, then a borrower should be able to opt out of such a onerous escrow arrangement. If Green Tree is able to charge people XXXX of dollars more each year for these \" supposed escrow shortages '' it 's no wonder they require borrowers to have an escrow account. We should be able to pay our own property taxes and insurance to avoid the financial hardship that Green Tree is creating. We are currently stuck with this mortgage company, but at the first opportunity we will make every effort to change lenders. But I do n't believe we should be penalized because we are stuck with this company. A company we did not voluntarily enter into a contract with. It should not be legal for a mortgage company to require consumers to have an escrow account that costs them hundreds of dollars more per year than it would cost if that consumer paid their own property taxes and insurance. I do n't know if this practice is legal but it should n't be and it definitely needs to be investigated. \\n\n",

They even called my oldest daughters boyfriend, who has never been affiliated with me, on a phone number he just received 3 days ago. I have told them to not call me again, I do not owe this debt and the calls keep coming. They are now stating that they have a case against me and they want my home or work address so they can serve me papers. I want this to stop. \\n\n",

Today i received a call from them saying that my account was past due.now, they never sent me a letter in the mail saying that i owed them money after i have requested a payoff and paid the balance in full. they are attempting to report my account past due for 33 days with the credit reporting agencies. i have worked tirelessly to build my credit, and now Citizens bank wants to destroy over {$27.00} when they never had any type of notification in place to make me aware of the balance. \\n\n",

During the process of approximately 14 months, of continuing to send them documents after documents. The same documents many times. Having approximatley XXXX different representatives helping us. With each time a change in representative, meant us sending again the same documents. Also, we found out that some had different answers than others. At the beginning of this process, we were told by Citi Mortgage that in order to be approved to continue to go on with the modification process, we had to be 4 months behind. If we are current that shows Citi Mortgage there is no need for a modification. So that is what we did. I will say that is the dumbest thing we did. Than we ended up to where out acct ended up in foreclosure status, and we could no longer make payments. After many, many months of frustration we contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to have them help us with the process. We started with them in XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, we are still working with them. XXXX XXXX XXXX representative tells me that Citi Mortgage continues to ask for documents. XXXX of many frustrating moments is with XXXX at Citi Mortgage. We have sent multiple times a letter stating in regards to some land we have. It was stated to her in detail that this land is a cash rent land. There is no mortgage on the land, it was in-heritated. It is split between my husband and his XXXX siblings. That the land is crop land only. We stated who farms it, the amount we receive. XXXX decided to determine we had a home on this property. Which delayed things again. There was never any indication of a XXXX home. If she would have read the answer to her question on this property, she should have known that it is crop land only. Is a field of weeds until the farmer puts the crop in. That we get a payment XXXX a year. not monthly as she was assuming. We have been served papers today by the attorney for Citi Mortgage, but yet they continue to call us daily. We do not speak to them as that is what XXXX XXXX XXXX is for. \\nThis process has taken way too long. Many of the documents that they keep asking for do not change. The only thing that changes slightly is our pay stubs and bank statements. We need help to get this finalized. \\n\n",

The amount of XXXX was the amount overdrawn. This was all done on accident which I had explained to The Risk department and The Recovery Department at Bank of America. I Also asked for statements and transactions to be mailed to me showing these movements. The Representatives that assisted me had no knowledge of what was happening, all I have been trying to do is pay all my debt to all the banks and financial institutions, I am really trying to get my life straight I am a XXXX, I am XXXX and looking for a job. I 'm trying to get ahead in life and better my chances to having a bright future. Bank of America is Reporting that I am A High Risk Fraud, according to XXXX XXXX Bank, This was displayed to me By A XXXX XXXX Bank Branch Manager, he showed me the screen after running my social security number. I did not commit fraud, and they refuse to show me or explain to me what evidence they have to be reporting that I am a high risk for Fraud, I recently got a consumer report from XXXX and they have reported Abuse on the account, but not Fraud, so I do n't understand why this bank is reporting me as Fraud to all the Banks, I called call check systems on XXXX to verify what I had seen on the XXXX XXXX Screen when I applied for an account with them, and they said that there is nothing reporting under Fraud only under Paid In full and the reason I was on XXXX is under the category of Account Abuse for the overdraft that was not paid. This is highly affecting my personal Life and my financial situation. Please help me in resolving this. I do n't have money for an attorney at this time and I feel like no one is helping me resolve this I am honestly trying to do the right thing by paying my debt and I do n't believe this is not fair for Bank of America to Call me Fraudulent and report it to other banks, and yet not be able to send me proof of this or to notify me that my status with them is Fraud, I feel really disrespected and I felt like I was treated wrong they are holding information form me but reporting it to the banks this does not make senses to me. Why would they say I 'm a High Risk for Fraud and not have it on file it 's only being communicated through banks not XXXX. I do n't think it 's ok to get a report with a status on this account as Abuse, but then go to a Bank and find out that its more than just Account Abuse, but Fraud. I Honestly hope you can help me with this or refer me to someone that can, I will continue researching and reaching out to any Government agency that can help me with this Injustice. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\n",

I called immediately to ask what it 's from and they would n't give any information and said I can pay XXXX of it to settle it but that the legal process would n't stop. I asked how much half would be and they said XXXX, but the amount of suit on the summons is listed as XXXX. I hung up and called again and was given different information. I was told I could make a payment of {$400.00} and monthly installments and it would halt the legal process. I do n't know what this debt is for or how much I actually owe and I 'm getting different information from different people. When I said I was unemployed they just sat on the phone in silence. \\n\n",

Which I dont see why would that be a problem she is my wife we are trying to save when our pay check come in she write all the check to our billers and XXXX to our saving account. When I deposit the check again Ally freeze my account and they reason being is being I had too many checks coming from her.

XXXX assigned the loan to XXXX Bank. XXXX transferred the loan to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX escrowed {$26000.00} from XXXX XXXX to replace our XXXX. XXXX released {$8900.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The XXXX replacement was completed by XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX transferred the loan servicing, including the insurance escrow funds, to Green Tree Servicing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

Later, when I found out they had charged me {$21.00} in addition to the {$1.00}, I called them to cancel the charge and the account they said I had opened. Their representatives made me wait a long time on the phone before I could even talk to someone, and even then I found no legitimate reason for the charge. They said it was for a monthly membership but I told them I was not interested in this service. But they said I could not cancel it even though it was the XXXX day of the month-long \" service. '' I have no idea what service they are providing and would like my money back. \\n\n",

No problem with XXXX. XXXX required a written application be mailed to them and Transunion steered me to a new page or website where I was not allowed to proceed without subscribing to a service which required me to pay an initial fee of {$1.00} for the report ( {$0.00} for my \" score '' ) and further agreeing to and paying a recurring charge of approximately {$18.00}. It is my belief that I am entitled under the law to a FREE credit report. why is TransUnion being permitted to violate the law with this deceptive practice? Please remedy this violation and require them to send me a free credit report as soon as possible. \\n\n",

I was recently incarcerated and my account was therefore locked. While incarcerated, my sister, who is my power of attorney, attempted to work with Direct Express to access my funds to cover my living expenses and they stated that they would not release the funds because I was in jail. In no contract or agreement anywhere online or in physical possession does it state that a beneficiary of VA XXXX benefits shall be rejected coverage while incarcerated, so that is my XXXX issue. \\n\\nI was released from XXXX XXXX jail on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and immediately upon release, I contacted Direct Express at XXXX to unlock my account. They XXXX requested proof of release and I faxed the documentation to XXXX. I followed up on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and Direct Express confirmed that they had the fax, but now they needed XXXX forms of picture identification. Since I currently have no money, I walked to a printing company and faxed XXXX forms of picture identification. I called again today ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) to follow up and they said, \" we do n't need XXXX forms of picture identification ; we only need the proof of release '' and much to my surprise, now they DO NOT have it and that it takes up to 6 business days to obtain the proof of release that I faxed on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I asked to speak to a supervisor and the person hung up on me. I called back, explained my situation again, asked to speak to a supervisor, was put on a long hold, and the same representative by the name of \" XXXX '' stated that a supervisor is unable to speak to me until Direct Express receives my faxed proof of release, which could take up to 6 days. He hung up on me after I further questioned their practices. \\n\n",

            "194324                 Mortgage                                                                                                                      This complaint is because we have attempted to have our mortgage payment modified numerous times since I suffered an injury at work which in turn greatly reduced our income. Since that happened we have tried to have Bank of America work with us to keep our home and payments manageable and they have done nothing to assist us in applying for a modification. However, over the past 3 years our requests have been ignored, paperwork reportedly never received, our phone calls were not returned and our phone numbers were changed in their computer system to an unknown number. Below will outline the issues as they have occurred. It is crucial that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene as they play to auction our home on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. In XXXX I took a loan from my XXXX to catch up with payments. Later that year I closed my XXXX fund to attempt to prevent foreclosure. At this time we informed them we would not be able to maintain the regular payments and requested a modification. XXXX XXXX, was assigned actually provided us with a list of necessary documents and they were faxed to him in the beginning of XXXX XXXX from a Bank of America branch location in XXXX, XXXX on XXXX XXXX, by a customer service representative named XXXX XXXX The original copies of the documents sent are available if needed. On XXXX XXXX, we were informed, that we were automatically removed from the modification program. Clarification was not provided. However, Bank of America knew that we planned to returned our account to good standing XXXX my XXXX 's XXXX XXXX was settled at on XXXX. In XXXX we paid {$17000.00} to Bank of America in attempt to keep our home. From that point communication stalled with Bank of America although we informed them we could not pay the current mortgage payment at over {$1800.00} per month. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a payment was made in the amount of {$5600.00} to Bank of America from a check withdrawn from XXXX XXXX XXXX bank, check XXXX. Knowing that this would be the XXXX time we would be receiving any bulk money and at this time we would start receiving regular income as I had been approved for Social Security XXXX, we again requested to apply for a modification while on the phone making the payment. We were told we would be contacted by a new assigned account manager. No one contacted us. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I contacted Bank of America again to start a modification process, I spoke with XXXX. I expressed my concern with Bank XXXX XXXX inability to willingly assist us in seeking a modification. She assured me this time would be different and to call her with issues. On XXXX XXXX, we received in the mail the paperwork from XXXX, and it states that it is due back XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from Bank of America representative and I immediately requested that they call me back in 15 minutes because I was trying to get my children out and I did not want to discuss this matter in front of them. I recall emphasizing please call me back, I did not even ask for the persons information. I did not receive a call back. About 3 hours later I called back the number on my caller ID, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and there was a message that there was a high call volume due to weather. Realizing I did not even know who I was calling I hung up and waited for them to contact me again. On XXXX XXXX, I still had no contact from BOA and attempted to call XXXX back, I was redirected to the account manager, XXXX. I asked about the call on XXXX XXXX and she stated that she thought I was calling her back. I stated, you did not provide me with a name or number, how was I suppose to locate you? She informed me that my house is scheduled to be auctioned on XXXX XXXX. In the past year we have been assigned XXXX account managers, none have ever called our home, except XXXX a week ago. \\n\n",

They say I authorized a loan XXXX 2011 from \" XXXX payday loan ''. I have never done so. They claim to be \" concord resolution inc ''. The man would not let me question anything, talked over me loudly and rudely, and knew my social, which he said in its entirety over the phone. They also had an old address and the bank I belong to. I was threatened if I didnt pay XXXX in 10 days that my wages would be garnished and I would be taken to court, where a judge would impose my delinquint balance at 300 % interest and I would have to pay their attourney fees and court costs.

On XXXX/XXXX/2015 at XXXX Called Bank of America ( BOA ) spoke to XXXX XXXX ID # : XXXX Said the account has been charged off, the loan has been forgiven and is no longer. XXXX transferred me to Charge off dpt. where I spoke to XXXX and said yes the account has been charged off. I asked BOA what is the reason for a short sale when the account has been charged off and is no longer, written off, no balance, loan has been forgiven?. Once BOA realized there was a potential for getting some income from the primary loan then the story changed. BOA is telling us that the account has been charged off however is still eligible for collection. How can you collect on something that is no longer? I asked ... Then the verbiage changed from the account is charged off to account not being written off and that written off means loan amt has been forgiven however charged off the loan can still be collected on. \\n\n",

            "194696  Bank account or service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Separate from my claim yesterday, I now alleged criminal behavior on the part of XXXX XXXX presented an XXXX Divorce Document to the Branch Manger of Citizens Bank in XXXX, XXXX-XXXX. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and requested past Bank Statements for the period between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. She promptly pulled up the account on her computer screen and even pointed out the initial deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. Reported to me that it was open in credit status only because there were notes for pending research on fees that were supposed to be reversed over 5 years ago. She then, despite my verbal opposition and the court order in front of her, insisted that she had to close the account because I was getting divorced and should not have a joint account with my spouse and that we were no longer eligible for any applicable credits. She then assured me I would have the requested statements within 2 weeks ( records over 7 years old require the processing of a research fee-despite my physically viewing the XX/XX/XXXX Statement on XXXX XXXX 's Screen ). She then informed me that it would cost about {$180.00} in fees and that I would have to come into the branch and pay that when I pick of the Statements, implied to be just after XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this arrangement constitutes a formal contract for the reproduction of the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX Statements that she showed me on her screen. \\n\\nToday XX/XX/XXXX, after filing reports with various stake holder groups last evening ( including you ) as well as citizens bank corporate offices, I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX manager XXXX XXXX ( actually located at the XXXX XXXX branch ) and was informed that the account records had been purged in \" XX/XX/XXXX '' after the account had been closed by XXXX XXXX, which is would have been in strict opposition to the court docs presented to XXXX XXXX and a follow-up email on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX ( attached ) reiterating this as well as pointing out the issue of why the account was open for credits only ( refund of fees ) as XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAfter, in casually speaking with a Law Firm not XXXX blocks from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I can confidently say that I believe XXXX XXXX committed a criminal act, fraud actually, as a refund of $ 2,800+ in fee 's described in the attached email to her on XX/XX/XXXX would effect XXXX XXXX XXXX Profits for that branch and therefore impact her performance bonus as branch manager. \\n\\nI would also like to reiterate that XXXX XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was extraordinarily helpful and I believe sincerely tried to reverse the deletion and obtain the records for me going back 7 years. She also stated that if I get a direct Subpoena from Indiana to her she could forward it to legal, who has access to all of my account records since inception at a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as many others, but they would only comply with the Federal mandate of 7 years old ( which I have ), it is the XXXX year which is essential as it shows my direct contribution to my wife 's education over that year ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) which is relevant under XXXX Divorce Law. \\n\\nTransparency and customer access to records physically shown to me in person XXXX month ago ( XXXX literally pointed out the opening deposit on XX/XX/XXXX ) is not asking anything out of line when complying with a court order. I also believe I should have access to the exact information that she purged after my email, as I should have access to whatever personal financial information so material in XXXX XXXX 's interests that she knowingly and deliberately permanently deleted the record of it. \\n\n",

I have made payments on time and have been current on the mortgage for several years. I have cancelled checks to prove it as well as statements from Chase. Chase however says I am XXXX payments behind from XXXX. I sent them a letter and documentation showing all payments were made and on time. After XXXX weeks, they sent me a letter that actually I was late in XXXX and that for the past several years, they have been putting my payments in a suspense account and periodically took money from suspense to pay the loan. I was never told there was such a suspense account and was surprised since I was current with payments for years. In a nutshell, they set up a suspense account without telling me and while my statements from Chase said they received my payments, they did n't tell me they were applying them to some suspense account instead of applying them to the loan. Because they believe I am XXXX payments behind, they returned my XXXX XXXX payment because they want XXXX payments in full. I explained I made all the payments and do n't owe them that money. The customer service rep. has only returned XXXX of the XXXX calls I placed to her and did n't have an answer for why there is a suspense account. She would not take all my cancelled checks for XXXX but I faxed them to Chase anyway. This has been going on since XXXX XXXX. Chase needs to find the missing money and apply my payments to my mortgage and not to a suspense account. And they need to tell the credit bureaus I am and have been current on my loan. And they need to reverse the late fee they applied in XXXX since I was n't late. And last they need to let me make my payments as I have been doing for many years. \\n\n",

This time we were behind by around 5 months. When they would call us, we would return the call only to be transferred to other areas, put on hold and noone actually answering the call. When I was able to pay on it, Flagstar refused to take our payment ( s ) if we were not making at least XXXX payments at a time. So we started mailing our payments in using postal money orders. Then our access to our account online was totally disabled by Flagstar. We were no longer able to see the activity on the acount. all we saw was a message that said our mortgage had been sold to another servicer, and that the new servicer would be contacting us via letter. That was over three to four months ago and we still have not heard anything. And nobody from Flagstar will communicate with us. \\n\\nThis is not the first unpleasant incident we have had with Flagstar Bank. They were the originators of our mortgage when we purchased our home. The interest rate on XXXX the XXXX and XXXX mortgage was high, but manageable. I notified them when my wife took ill and they suggested a modification and told us we had to be at least 90 days past due to be eligible. We did as they suggested only to have our paperwork lost. We re-submitted and heard nothing. Then we found out our XXXX mortgage had been sold to another institution. So now they only held our XXXX mortgage ( which to our surprise was actually a home equity loan ). As time went by we proceded to try and get the mortgage they held modified. We complied with all of their requests, and again, paperwork was lost or deemed incomplete. So I sent an additional copy only to have one of their employees send an email to her manager that had unprofessional remarks about our attempt to get a modification ( yes, she inadvertently cc 'd us on the email ). When I responded to both her and her manager about my displeasure of the contents in the email, the manager immediately replied to us with a favorable reduction in the interest rate along with a change in the repayment terms from being amortized over 30 years and monthly payments for fifteen years with a balloon payment at the end of the fifteen years, to a loan amortized over 20 years that pays off the entire loan in that time frame. \\n\\nIt has been months since we have heard from them. And we still have no idea where our loan is. \\n\n",

The procedures are in {$25.00} increments. I have ( 1 ) opened a checking account with Mobile Banking ( 2 ) enrolled int he merit rewards program and ( 3 ) I do participate in the direct deposit program to the account. Since I have opened this account I have been receiving fees of {$35.00} stating that I have had many overdrafts. I have discussed with the bank that I have a tight budget and call and go on-line constantly but they always seem to place the blame on the merchant and hold money for 2 to 3 days knowing that the purchase was made when I had the money in my account. I have been charged almost {$300.00} in overdraft fees in 3 months since I opened the checking account. I have not seen the {$150.00} activation reward in my account nor do I merit all of the fees that First Merit has charged to my account. \\n\n",

There is a break in the chain of title of & gt ; the mortgage. MERS transferred the mortgage to Nationstar on & gt ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but before that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX Freddie & XXXX XXXX Mac owned the mortgage & gt ; ( please see attachment from attorney XXXX XXXX that I havesubmitted for complete information on this. ) Further, The process for \" loan modification review '' lasted from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX while the foreclosure process was moving along and is now is the final stages of the Judiciary process. \\nI feel that Nationstar did not act in a timely manner and is not following guidelines for a fair loan modification on this property. Reason for mod denial is that the \" delinquent amount due '' is too high to produce a lower mortgage when that amount has been increasing steadily as the loan mod review has taken so long. Nationstar regularly asked for documents, and then when those were in, found more documents they needed ; documents that had \" timed out '' while Nationstar continued to request new documents had to be resubmitted. The process would begin again for review ; the request for additional documents would come XXXX by XXXX as the time ticked away and the \" review '' could notbe completed yet! I worked diligently with Nationstar to complete the \" Borrower 's Packet '' and qualify for a Loan Modification. I do n't feel that they have worked to meet my needs in a timely fashion and may not have followed the correct guidelines for a Loan Modification on my behalf. There also seems to be some illegal activity around my account, per the documentation that I have provided in an attachment from Attorney XXXX XXXX. A Sale Date is certainly immanent now on this property. Though XXXX XXXX has given me some council on this matter, he is not currently my attorney. I am working with Legal Aid of Hawaii now to hope to stop the foreclosure. Their resources only allow for Loan Modification assistance. Without immediate attention to this matter, Nationstar will likely foreclose on my property, as there was a sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX which was \" post-phoned '' by the XXXX Commissioner while the Loan Modification Denial Appeal Review was in progress. \\nMy appeal for Loan Mod.

He leaves numerous messages. He has called my parents, my brother, and most likely other individuals that share my last name. I called him today and he threatened me by saying that if I did not pay a certain amount that legal action would be taken. He hassled me to ask family members for money. I told him NOT to call my parents as I have not lived with them for 15 years and they would not be paying this debt on my behalf. \\n\n",

            "195003         Credit reporting  In XX/XX/XXXX, while discussing an unrelated business mater with a current lender, I was made aware that an account, I did not authorize or initiate, had me listed as a cosigner. I immediately notified the lender that I was a victim of identity fraud and requested to see the information they had on file. In turn, I checked my credit reports, confirmed the presence of the fraudulent account, and contacted each of the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit reporting companies and disputed the information. At varying dates in XX/XX/XXXX, each of the credit reporting companies ( CRCs ) reported that the account was confirmed by the lender. To date, the fraudulent information remains on my credit file and [ neither ] CRC has ever notated my credit profile about the account being disputed. \\n\\nAfter [ several ] additional telephonic requests to the lender between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, the lender mailed me a copy of the loan origination documents along with its internal ID theft package. I immediately filed a law enforcement report ( LER ) with my local Sheriff XXXX Office and returned the original package and supporting documentation to the lender in XX/XX/XXXX. The supporting documentation included a copy of the lender 's loan origination document, my LER, drivers license, social security card, and hand writing samples. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified by a potential employer that I was deemed unsuitable due the presence of delinquent financial information on my credit report. In that same notification, I was provided a copy of my combined credit report which still contained the fraudulent account on each of the CRC 's reports. I began researching laws and learned about the FCRA and the FTC. After learning that the combination of an LER and FTC Identity Theft Affidavit ( ITA ) produce an Identity Theft Report ( IDR ), I filed an ITA on the FTC 's website. \\n\\nIn turn, I sent [ via certified mail ] FTC 's CRC-template letters and supporting documentation to each of the XXXX credit reporting companies requesting that the fraudulent account be blocked, removed, and that a extended fraud alert be placed on my credit file as per the FCRA. The supporting documentation for each submission of FTC 's CRC-template letter included a copy of the lender 's loan origination document ; my credit report, drivers license, social security card, and hand writing samples ; as well as FCRA Section 611. \\n\\nAccording to XXXX tracking, the CRCs received their certified letters on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX [ XXXX ], respectively. To date, each CRC has placed an extended fraud alert but has [ not ] blocked the fraudulent account information from my respective credit profile [ or ] contacted me declining my request to block the fraudulent information. In fact, XXXX CRC will not allow me to order a credit report directly and advised ( via telephone ) that my IDR was not sufficient but would not provide its justification method in making that determination. Subsequently, and, respectively, I have ordered additional credit reports which indicate each CRC 's non-compliance the FCRA 's imposed time limits. To their credit, XXXX CRCs have listed the fraudulent account as disputed/under investigation. \\n\\nAdditionally, I sent [ for the XXXX time, via certified mail ] FTC 's lender-template letter and supporting documentation to the lender requesting that the lender block, absolve me of responsibility, and stop inaccurately furnishing the fraudulent account information to the CRCs.

The guy told me he was going to come to my work tomorrow to \" serve '' me. He said he just wanted to give me the heads up. Obviously, this shocked me. I asked him what charges and from whom. He said he could not tell me that, but he could give me the party 's number ( XXXX ) and my case number. I immediately called the number he gave me. It was Dispute Resolution Services. My \" case manager '' ( XXXX XXXX ) says I owe them {$2900.00} from a check into cash loan I got on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX said that if I did not resolve this today, I would be served by the guy that originally called me, who would be accompanied by a uniformed officer and that my boss would also have to sign the papers. I asked why they were coming to my work. He told me that they would try my house XXXX, but if they failed to find me there, they would go to my work. I asked when they were planning on doing this. He said between XXXX and XXXX tomorrow. He told me I could face up to 1 year in jail and have to pay an additional {$1000.00} penalty because they are charging me with check fraud under section XXXX of some law. I asked him if I could get a copy of the application from the original debtor and he said no, stating that the application was to be used against me in court. I told him I was going to need to call him back, because I was at work and a bit in shock from what he was saying. He said he would be able to give me until XXXX to call him back, or he would move forward with these charges and he gave me his extension ( XXXX ). After getting off the phone with him, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify this debt. They said they sold my debt to XXXX, but XXXX is known for allowing other debtors collect on their behalf. She said many times, these are scams and get people to pay way more than what they actually owe. I was on the phone with her for a long time while she tried to find this company and/or anything about XXXX XXXX. The only thing she found said that they had their license revoked a few years ago. She was very sweet and reassured me that I was not going to jail and that she would contact XXXX to notify them of this situation. She also gave me XXXX 's number to follow up with them myself. I called XXXX, but they were closed and the voice recording asked me to leave my phone number and my full social security number.. umm, no thanks! I then called XXXX XXXX back at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( at XXXX ). XXXX did n't answer. I left him XXXX voice mails from XXXX to XXXX. NO CALL BACK!! Now, I have to go to work tomorrow in fear that a cop and some guy will show up to serve me, to publicly humiliate me and/or threaten me with more scary tactics like \" jail time '' and \" thousands of dollars in penalties ''. \\n\n",

The late payments correspond to errors committed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX unilaterally and incorrectly directed the monthly payments to payment of insurance, this error was subsequently corrected ( prove of the inaccuracy ) ; nevertheless the late payments continue to appear on my report. I am requesting that the account is removed due to this inaccuracy. \\n\n",

I signed up two months ago to check my score. Now it is time to cancel because {$40.00} a month is too expensive. The only way to cancel Equifax is to call a XXXX number. It is a long and drawn out process. Finally we talk to someone ( husband and I ) in a foreign country. They ask all sorts of annoying questions and hard sell continued service. The XXXX time they even hung up. We spent a half hour or more just to cancel the darn service!!!! They shoudl provide many more options for cancelling, INCLUDING cancelling online, for crying out loud. \\nXXXX is even worse. I logged in to check my score and the info is not made available. It keeps on kicking me out. To cancel, I have to call yet another XXXX number. It is so painfully obvious that they are just sucking the automatic payments right out of you and making cancellation so hard that most people simply give up. \\n\n",

I had opened another business account with Wells earlier that year ( even though I never applied for a credit card with that account -- they sent me one -- claiming I had applied ). As a result of that previous issue, when I went into the branch on XXXX XXXX, 2014, I specifically advised the banker, that I did not want any credit cards, and only wanted a Business Checking account -- and nothing more. I spent close to an hour discussing the account with the Banker ( his name was XXXX XXXX -- his family were attorneys in XXXX XXXX, with his grandfather having been a XXXX -the Federal Building bears his name ). XXXX XXXX fully understood I did n't want any credit cards. \\nTwo or three weeks after opening the account, I received a notice from Wells Fargo that my business had been approved for a {$15000.00} credit card. I immediately went into the Wells Branch and met with XXXX XXXX -- he advised me he had learned of the credit card and had reason to believe that an employee within his branch had forged my signature -- as he did not submit a credit card application. He further advised me that upon learning of the credit card he told the branch manager that I did not apply for a credit card nor did I sign any authorization for a credit card. XXXX XXXX suggested that I should request all documents from the Bank regarding my business account -- which I did ; the documents I received -- contained XXXX signatures -- only XXXX of those signatures is mine. The other signature is a forgery. \\nI have brought this to the attention of Wells Fargo ; they have told me they would investigate -- I sent a follow-up email to the person supposedly handling the matter at Wells Fargo -- yesterday she responded that she would ignore all of my emails and not provide me with any response -- it was as though this person was covering up for the person that forged my signature. \\n\n",

Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX OH contacted said collection firm and asked to set up a payment schedule - debited directly from my bank account. Attorney XXXX NEVER had a call returned from XXXX XXXX the contact person on record for this action with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX OH. I am on XXXX, as my only source of income. \\nBeing a seasonal employee at XXXX XXXX in XXXX - I was contacted by XXXX XXXX that my wages would be garnished at 25 % of net pay, when I worked for XXXX XXXX - working for XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX - I had {$2800.00} garnished from my paychecks - a MAJOR setback for my finances as my XXXX barely covers my monthly overhead. \\nEfforts by Attorney XXXX to reach XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX to arrive at an equitable monthly payment - directly debited from my account. Went unanswered by phone and writing. \\nA complete written history since judgement was rendered by the court toward my effort to establish payment schedule, through counsel is 100 % factual. This Collection agency - XXXX XXXX XXXX has totally ignored all requests by counsel & has circumvented equitable protocol to establish a payment schedule for re-payment of this debt. \\n\n",

We filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy protection in XXXX XXXX, including our mortgage in the filing. All mortgage payments & arrearages were being serviced per our Trustee 's Agreement on time, & without prejudice, even as we attempted to refinance our mortgage to a much more advantageous rate. We finally found someone to do an FHA Streamline on our mortgage, when we were informed that XXXX XXXX XXXX filed an insurance claim in XXXX XXXX against our FHA MIP due to our loan \" being delinquent. '' Our mortgage was then \" picked up '' by Caliber Home Loans, whom we were informed would be our new loan servicer. We were also told we no longer had an FHA Loan, according to Caliber. We have no idea how we could be taken out of our FHA loan-preventing our Streamline Refinance- & put into some \" XXXX status '' as we were informed that our mortgage is now in. In addition, we are still paying FHA MIP payments in our mortgage payments on our mortgage since Caliber took over our mortgage, as well as we have yet to have our mortgage payments be reduced after a significant drop in our homeowners policy as well. \\n\n",

My mortage holder forclosed on my loan because of accounting errors on their part and applied forced insurance amounts to my account statements and spread sheets when we already have our home insured thru State farm insurance agency. We would make payments to the mortage company and they would in term send our payments back or would deny that they receive them at all. We are doing the best that we can with making our payments on time but it is very hard to do with our lender threating us with forclosure notices.
